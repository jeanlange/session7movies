This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It's a demo of calling APIs with React - we call 3 APIs:
* themoviedb for a list of movies
* Watson Discovery API for news results about the movies
* Twitter for tweets about the movies (currently commented out)

To run it:
* npm install
* npm start

In a separate tab, run:
* corsproxy

You will need auth keys for the API that you use - insert them in `MovieCard.js`. Check out #codeovertime for those. Good luck finding them if you're not in Academy! :D
